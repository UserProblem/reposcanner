# Go API Server for swagger

This is a simple backend API to allow a user to configure repositories for scanning, trigger a scan of those repositories, and retrieve the results.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
